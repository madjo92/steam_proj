However, the sequel features an all-new world, along with newly created improved battle system and level design.Developer CommentFor Bright Memory: Infinite, I wanted to focus on adding content to give players a more satisfying experience. As a result, development took three times as long as Bright Memory. This process allowed me to learn how to create a strong game while dealing with time and financial constraints. I spent a lot of time thinking of ways to maximize whatever technology and resources available to me in order to deliver an unforgettable experience through the game. As such, Bright Memory: Infinite represents the culmination of FYQD Studio's growth. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all my global partners and those who have provided technical support to me.\n",
